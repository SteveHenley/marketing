### Approval Process

Preparation: Work with “Local Meetup support” channel to create proposal, @AyAyron will help you create it as an Issue within the reward.rchain.coop system.

Submit Proposal: After the proposal has been submitted, the “Events” lead for marketing will review and commit to sponsorship under the “post-meetup requirements” guidelines.

Post Approval: Continue to work with “Local Meetup support” to provide weekly updates on the execution of the plan.

If the proposal is for more than the avg. budget, beyond monthly budget, it will require @AyAyron support to escalate proposal to the “Events‘ team.

If the proposal is for a request for funds in advance of meetup, it will require @AyAyron’s support to escalate proposal directly to Events team. To set expectations, it is unlikely that advances will be given to unestablished teams.
